# What does this project do, and why is there only one file? 
I've noticed that the leads are using Python more and more (why not, it's simple, has a lot of modules, but it's slow), thus moving away from C. Although this project probably won't get more than 1 view and download, I'll develop it. All the new syntax is stored in one file, you will ask me "Why?", but I will tell you that this is the best alternative to creating or rewriting an interpreter + works on all devices that have C. 
# How likely is the chance that the C syntax will be made simpler? 
I'm not at all sure what's been going on with C lately, it's kind of there, but it's like it's not there. 
Yes, plus this language has already become the basis of many others, therefore, with a chance of 99.999999999%, it will not change
