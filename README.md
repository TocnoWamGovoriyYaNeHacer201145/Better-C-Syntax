# C24 Super Release
People are using [Python]() more and more (myself included), 
but skipping C because they can't understand even 1% of its syntax. 
That's why in C24+ we made the code more minimalistic, why do you need an interpreter when you can put a new syntax in one syntax.h file, 
also, ~~we didn't pay our employees, so it's just a shortened version of C23~~. In this revolutionary C, you'll get an unimaginable development experience and enjoy the readability of your code that [ChatGPT]() has kindly written to you (or whatever is writing code for you) without slowing down development (we don't promise).
